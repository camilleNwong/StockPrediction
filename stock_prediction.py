        - order: an integer repesenting the desired order of the markov chain

    returns: a dictionary that represents the Markov chain

### Predict

    Predict the next num values given the model and the last values.

### Error

    Calculate the mean squared error between two data sets.

### Experiment

def run_experiment(train, order, test, future, actual, trials):

    Run an experiment to predict the future of the test
    data given the training data.

        - test: a list of integers of length "order" representing past
                stock price data (different time period than "train")

                  predict
        - actual: a list representing the actual results for the next
                  "future" days
        - trials: an integer representing the number of trials to run

    returns: a float that is the mean squared error over the number of trials
